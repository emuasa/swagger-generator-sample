## Swagger generatror sample

This is a sample of use swagger generator. There are scripts to generate a node server and javascript and typescript clients.
Using a swagger.json file in the root path you can generate server and clients.

You can use it to share your swagger API specifications with other team, so that the remote team can incorporate your api into their applications using the client generated by this example and test their apps using the generated node server.

### How to use

1. Clone this repo.
1. Put the `swagger.json` file in the root join to `package.json`
1. Run scripts:
    * `npm run generate-server` generate the node server ready to go.
    * `npm run generate-javascript-client` generate the javascript client. 
    * `npm run generate-typescript-client` generate the typescript client.  
    Both, javascript and typescript clients, are ready as npm package but you can extract the api client code and integrate it into your project.

### Extend it

Of course, you can add or change generation scripts, you can visit https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/wiki/API-client-generator-HOWTO and see a list of API clients available.
